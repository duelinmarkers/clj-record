h1. clj-record

clj-record is a library inspired by Rails' ActiveRecord but implemented in the 
"Clojure programming language":http://www.clojure.org/ and intended to use its 
functional idioms. It's a fairly thin layer on top of clojure.contrib.sql that 
provides validation, associations, and callbacks.

Contributions are welcome, as are recommendations for how to improve the API.

h2. The API

To define a model (in this case called "employee"), you do something like this.

<pre><code>
  (ns com.example.employee
    (:require clj-record.boot))

  (clj-record.core/init-model)
</code></pre>

It'll expect there to be an employees table. (At the moment you can't specify a different table name.)

The (clj-record.core/init-model) macro form with no extra arguments will expand 
into function definitions for basic crud operations: 

* get-record (by id)
* find-records (by map of attributes)
* insert (from a map of attributes, returning the generated id)
* create (from a map of attributes, returning the record itself)
* update (from a map of attributes including :id)
* destroy-record (from a map of attributes including :id)

See the functions of the same name in 
"clj-record.core":http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master/clj_record/core.clj 
for documentation.
(The model-name argument of the functions in clj-record.core is not needed 
when calling functions on the model namespace.)

Additional optional arguments can generate richer functionality.

h3. Associations

Do this.

<pre><code>
  (ns ...)

  (clj-record.core/init-model
    (:associations
      (belongs-to account)
      (has-many subscriptions)))
</code></pre>

Then you can do things like this.

<pre><code>
  (let [mikey (user/get-record 2)
        subs (user/find-subscriptions mikey)]
    (doseq [subscription subs] (println (format "%s subscribed to %s" (:name mikey) (:name sub))))
    (user/destroy-subscriptions mikey)
    (println "But not any more."))
</code></pre>

h3. Validations

Do this.

<pre><code>
  (ns ...)

  (clj-record.core/init-model
    (:validation
      (:name "Longer please." #(> (count %) 3))))
</code></pre>

Then you get validation errors like this.

<pre><code>
  => (user/validate {:name "POO"})
  {:name ["Longer please."]}
</code></pre>

h3. Callbacks...

...have just started making their way into working. It's about what you'd expect.

<pre><code>
  (clj-record.core/init-model
    (:callbacks
      (:before-save fn-that-transforms-a-record)))
</pre></code>

clj-record is being TDD'd (nearly 100%) using clojure.contrib.test-is, largely 
with high-level full-stack tests, so see 
"the tests":http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master/clj_record/test 
for details of everything that works. 

See "TODO.txt":http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master/TODO.txt 
for what else I'm thinking about, and feel free to suggest.

h2. Running

Run ./test as a clj script to run tests. In addition to clojure-contrib, you'll need "Apache Derby":http://db.apache.org/derby/ on your classpath. (Or you can uncomment and modify a different db-spec in clj-record/test/config.clj and use MySQL or PostgreSQL.)

h2. The Name...

...is awful. Recommendations are welcome.
